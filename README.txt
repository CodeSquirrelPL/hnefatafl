A web app that lets you play an ancient game of Hnefatafl, either locally on one device or via web connection.

Currently in Polish, but I am working on translation, as well as improving security and overall experience.

Features:

- play on one device
- create account
- log in and log out
- challenge other users
- accept or reject challenges from other users
- list all other users
- play with other users (at this moment requires manual refreshing after each move)
